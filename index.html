            <h2 id="T1">A brief look into the life of Fyodor Dostoyevsky:</h2>
            <p>Born in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends, 
                and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, 
                he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After graduating, 
                he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. 
                In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry into St.<span class="dots">...</span>
              
              <span class="more"> 
          Petersburg's literary circles. 
                Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group that discussed banned books critical of Tsarist Russia, 
                he was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a Siberian prison camp, 
                followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, 
                publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later A Writer's Diary, a collection of his writings. 
                He began to travel around western Europe and ssdeveloped a gambling addiction, which led to financial hardship.</span></p>

            <p>
               Dostoevsky completed his first novel, Poor Folk, in May 1845. 
                His friend Dmitry Grigorovich, with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, 
                took the manuscript to the poet Nikolay Nekrasov, 
                who in turn showed it to the renowned and influential literary critic Vissarion Belinsky. Belinsky described it as Russia's first "social novel"
                Poor Folk was released on 15 January 1846 in the St Petersburg Collection almanac and became a commercial success.
                Dostoevsky felt that his military career would endanger his now flourishing literary career,<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">
                so he wrote a letter asking to resign his post. Shortly thereafter, he wrote his second novel, The Double, 
                which appeared in the journal Notes of the Fatherland on 30 January 1846, before being published in February. 
                Around the same time, Dostoevsky discovered socialism through the writings of French thinkers Fourier, Cabet, Proudhon and Saint-Simon. 
                Through his relationship with Belinsky he expanded his knowledge of the philosophy of socialism. He was attracted to its logic, 
                its sense of justice and its preoccupation with the destitute and the disadvantaged. 
                However, his relationship with Belinsky became increasingly strained as Belinsky's atheism and dislike of religion clashed with Dostoevsky's 
                Russian Orthodox beliefs. Dostoevsky eventually parted with him and his associates.</span></p>

            <h2 id="T3">Release from prison and first marriage (1854–1866):</h2>
            <p>
              After his release on 14 February 1854, Dostoevsky asked Mikhail to help him financially and to send him books by Vico, 
    Guizot, Ranke, Hegel and Kant. The House of the Dead, 
    based on his experience in prison, was published in 1861 in the journal Vremya – it was the first published novel about Russian prisons.
    Before moving in mid-March to Semipalatinsk, where he was forced to serve in the Siberian Army Corps of the Seventh Line Battalion, 
    Dostoevsky met geographer Pyotr Semyonov and ethnographer Shokan Walikhanuli. 
    Around November 1854, he met Baron Alexander Egorovich Wrangel, an admirer of his books, 
    who had attended the aborted execution. 
    They both rented houses in the Cossack Garden outside Semipalatinsk. Wrangel remarked that Dostoevsky "looked morose. 
    His sickly, pale face was covered with freckles,<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">
    and his blond hair was cut short. He was a little over average height and looked at me intensely with his sharp, grey-blue eyes. 
    It was as if he were trying to look into my soul and discover what kind of man I was."
    In Semipalatinsk, Dostoevsky tutored several schoolchildren and came into contact with upper-class families, including that of Lieutenant-Colonel Belikhov, 
    who used to invite him to read passages from newspapers and magazines. During a visit to Belikhov, 
    Dostoevsky met the family of Alexander Ivanovich Isaev and Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva and fell in love with the latter. Alexander Isaev took a new post in Kuznetsk, 
    where he died in August 1855. Maria and her son then moved with Dostoevsky to Barnaul. In 1856 Dostoevsky sent a letter through Wrangel to General 
    Eduard Totleben, apologising for his activity in several utopian circles. 
    As a result, he obtained the right to publish books and to marry, although he remained under police surveillance for the rest of his life. 
    Maria married Dostoevsky in Semipalatinsk on 7 February 1857, even though she had initially refused his marriage proposal, 
    stating that they were not meant for each other and that his poor financial situation precluded marriage. Their family life was unhappy and she found it difficult to cope with his seizures. 
    Describing their relationship, he wrote: "Because of her strange, suspicious and fantastic character, we were definitely not happy together, but we could not stop loving each other; 
    and the more unhappy we were, the more attached to each other we became". They mostly lived apart. In 1859 he was released from military service because of deteriorating 
    health and was granted permission to return to European Russia, 
    first to Tver, where he met his brother for the first time in ten years, and then to St Petersburg.</span></p>

             <h2 id="T4">Second marriage and honeymoon (1866–1871):</h2>
            <p>
               The first two parts of Crime and Punishment were published in January and February 1866 in the periodical The Russian Messenger,
               attracting at least 500 new subscribers to the magazine.
              Dostoevsky returned to Saint Petersburg in mid-September and promised his editor, Fyodor Stellovsky, that he would complete The Gambler, 
              a short novel focused on gambling addiction, by November, although he had not yet begun writing it. One of Dostoevsky's friends, Milyukov, 
              advised him to hire a secretary. Dostoevsky contacted stenographer Pavel Olkhin from Saint Petersburg, who recommended his pupil, 
              the twenty-year-old Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> Her shorthand helped Dostoevsky to complete The Gambler on 30 October, after 26 days' work.
              She remarked that Dostoevsky was of average height but always tried to carry himself erect. "He had light brown, slightly reddish hair, 
              he used some hair conditioner, and he combed his hair in a diligent way ... his eyes, they were different: one was dark brown; in the other,
              the pupil was so big that you could not see its color, [this was caused by an injury]. The strangeness of his eyes gave Dostoyevsky some 
              mysterious appearance. His face was pale, and it looked unhealthy."
              On 15 February 1867 Dostoevsky married Snitkina in Trinity Cathedral, Saint Petersburg. The 7,000 rubles he had earned from Crime and 
              Punishment did not cover their debts, forcing Anna to sell her valuables. On 14 April 1867, they began a delayed honeymoon in Germany with 
              the money gained from the sale. They stayed in Berlin and visited the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, where he sought inspiration for
              his writing. They continued their trip through Germany, visiting Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Heidelberg and Karlsruhe. They spent five weeks 
              in Baden-Baden, where Dostoevsky had a quarrel with Turgenev and again lost much money at the roulette table.</span></p>

            <p>
              On 25 January 1881, while searching for members of the terrorist organisation Narodnaya Volya ("The People's Will") who would soon assassinate Tsar Alexander II,
the Tsar's secret police executed a search warrant in the apartment of one of Dostoevsky's neighbours[citation needed]. On the following day, 
Dostoevsky suffered a pulmonary haemorrhage. Anna denied that the search had caused it, saying that the haemorrhage had occurred after her 
husband had been looking for a dropped pen holder. After another haemorrhage, Anna called the doctors, who gave a poor prognosis. A 
third haemorrhage followed shortly afterwards. While seeing his children before dying, Dostoevsky requested that the parable of the Prodigal Son be read to his children. 
The profound meaning of this request is pointed out by Frank:
It was this parable of transgression, repentance, and forgiveness that he wished to leave as a last heritage to his children, and it may well be seen as his 
own ultimate understanding of 
the meaning of his life and the message of his work.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">
Among Dostoevsky's last words was his quotation of Matthew 3:14–15: "But John forbad him, saying, I have a need to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me?
And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness", and he finished with "Hear now—permit it. 
Do not restrain me!" When he died, his body was placed on a table, following Russian custom. He was interred in the Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Convent,
near his favourite poets, Nikolay Karamzin and Vasily Zhukovsky. It is unclear how many attended his funeral. According to one reporter, more than 100,000 mourners were present,
while others describe attendance between 40,000 and 50,000. 
His tombstone is inscribed with lines from the New Testament:
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it dies, it bringeth forth much fruit.
